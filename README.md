# LeoFunBot
Bot for discord

I started coding this bot cuz i was bored and tried to make it so it can kick a user everytime he speaks.

I then started adding more commands like the !kick @user that generates a RNG number and if the numbers = 1 the user gets kicked, i did the same with the ban command
but still needs some fixes like the permissions.

Most of the commands there are just for fun and i will try to make them more advanced so they can work properly all time, some of them can still crash.

Music bot to be added(not assured)

Fun commands like how gay to be added

Message embends to be added
